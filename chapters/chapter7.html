        <p>
            Due to the banning of thinking machines in the Dune universe, computers and computer networks do not exist.
            As mentioned in chapter 3, the network that Dune relies on in order to spread and store information is face
            to face communication between individuals. People are physically required to travel from place to place in
            order for any form of data to be transferred. In this way, the network of Dune is much more limited in terms
            of size and speed, but with that comes a much more secure network.

        </p>
        <p>
            The limited size of the network of Dune comes from the fact that in order to become part of the network of
            information, someone needs to specifically tell you the information. The small size of the network also
            means that there are very few access points into the network. Very specific people need to be targeted, and
            they need to willingly tell the information in order to allow someone new into the network. With the
            requirement of face-to-face communication, the chance of someone accidentally leaking important information,
            or bad agents reaching data that they should not have access to is significantly decreased.

        </p>
        <p>
            This however, does not entirely eliminate this possibility. In the Dune universe, spies and eavesdropping
            are the equivalent of hackers on Earth. On Earth, hackers try to gain access to private information by
            tapping into streams of data or databases. The Dune equivalent of this is, purposefully or not, overhearing
            private conversations. For example, when Paul overhears his mother talking with the Bene Gesserit about how
            he may be The One. To combat this, measures have been developed such as the silence field that prevent
            anyone outside of it from hearing the conversation, stopping any nearby persons from acquiring private
            knowledge. As well, moles and double agents can act as malware, not only wasting the resources of one side,
            but also collecting information for the other. We see this with the betrayal of Doctor Yueh, who is able to
            use his inside knowledge of the system to render the Duke of house Atreides completely helpless during the
            Harkonnen attack.

        </p>
        <p>
            Even though Dune does not have a computer network in the traditional sense, their network of information is
            still a highly important part of their society. While their much more analog way of dispersing information
            does lead to a much more secure network of communications, it is still not completely safe. Precautions
            still need to be put in place to ensure complete protection of private information and the people who have
            it.
