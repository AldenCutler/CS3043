            In the world of Dune, knowledge and information hold power and
            influence. The ability to control and manipulate information is
            a game-changer in the political and power dynamics in the story,
            like for example when the Harkonnens use their access to
            confidential information to plot the downfall of House Atreides.
            The Harkonnens infiltrate the House Atreides with Dr. Yue as a spy
            to monitor their
            plans before the attack on Arrakis [1]. This entire dynamic
            directly parallels real-world issues of national security and
            cyber-warfare. Just like the factions in Dune use almost every
            surveillance method available, from bugged rooms to
            infiltrations by human spies, our world is constantly locked in
            a tug-of-war between defending society and defending people’s
            right to privacy.

            Another case is the Bene Gesserit, a sisterhood that can access
            memories stored in their genes, allowing them to tap into their
            collective knowledge, as seen when the Reverend Mother tests
            Paul Atreides’ resilience [2]. This relates to real-world
            information privacy issues, specifically with the use of genetic
            information. With advances in gene research and DNA sequencing,
            we now have unprecedented access to people’s genetic
            information. Modern genomic companies and researchers can reveal
            personal details about a person’s behavioral traits or
            predisposition to diseases just from a sample of DNA [3].

            The spice melange in Dune is another example. It grants those
            who ingest it heightened consciousness and the ability to see
            into the future, allowing access to ‘privileged’ information
            that regular humans can’t obtain [4]. While there aren’t as many
            real-world parallels to be drawn from the spice, the important
            case of brain-computer interaction comes to mind. It might not
            be as dramatic as tapping into a collective mind, but there have
            been recent technological advances, like Neuralink [5] that
            suggest that one day, it might even be possible to monitor or
            manipulate someone’s thoughts and emotions against their will.
