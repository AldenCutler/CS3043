        <p>
            Work and especially wealth are two concepts at the heart of the story in Dune (2021). All “thinking
            machines” are outlawed in the Dune universe, including computers and artificial intelligence [1]. This is
            why the spice melange is one of the most important things in this universe: it allows people to replace
            computers for crucial tasks such as navigation through space. As the textbook says, “Information technology
            and efficient transportation systems make it easier for a leading product to dominate the worldwide market”
            [2]. The only difference is that, in Dune, the spice melange dominates the universal market. A single
            resource can make entire economies and power structures rise or fall. As Baron Harkonnen, former ruler of
            Arrakis says, “He who controls the spice, controls the universe” [3]. Whichever faction can secure Arrakis
            effectively has a chokehold on the economy of the entire universe, concentrating an unimaginable amount of
            wealth in the hands of that faction.
            <br><br>
            While our world may not have a spice melange quite like that of the Dune universe, some of Earth’s resources
            are similar in importance. Natural resources such as rare metals and minerals are vital to our society,
            powering our cars, phones, and computers. China is estimated to mine over 70% of the world’s ‘rare earths’
            and is responsible for over 90% of refining and production [3]. It supplies the United States with “21 of
            the 35 minerals that Washington deems critical for its national security and economy” [3]. Of $506.4 billion
            in U.S. imports from China in 2021, Machinery and Mechanical Appliances (47.7% of the total) and Base
            Metals, Iron, and Steel (5.6% of the total) were two of the largest proportions, adding up to around $269.9
            billion in imports from China [4].
            <br><br>
            In the universe of Dune, the concept of ‘work’ is also inextricably tied to the spice melange. For the
            oppressed Fremen natives of Arrakis, work quite literally means working in the dangerous open desert to
            extract the spice from the sand. The Fremen workforce is essentially slave labor, with no rights or share of
            the immense amount of wealth generated by their work. Even for those in control of Arrakis, their entire
            livelihood revolves around the work of harvesting, refining, and selling the spice. Military forces work to
            secure the spice fields and trade routes. Every aspect of work is centered around the goal of as much spice
            as possible. This mirrors how major industries here on Earth rely on the exploitation of workers. Just as
            the rulers of Arrakis exploit the Fremen to collect the spice, fashion brands like Forever 21 contract out
            the production of their products to vendors that don’t have to abide by any labor laws [5], exploiting
            workers who live in these countries.
